Tutorial 3: Library
===================

If you would like to create own library you should with this tutorial
which explains basic principles.

Skeleton
^^^^^^^^

HydraTK provides embedded command which creates library skeleton.
Execute command ``create-lib-skel``

  .. code-block:: bash
  
     $ htk create-lib-skel
    
     Completed. 
    
Skeleton is created in directory ~/hydratk/hydratk-lib-whiteforce.   

  .. code-block:: bash
  
     /doc - documentation
     /src - source code
       /hydratk
         /lib
           /whiteforce - library title
             __init__.py
             whiteforce.py - library code
           __init__.py
         __init__.py
     LICENSE.txt - license file with template text
     MANIFEST.in - manifest file with template text
     README.rst - readme file with template text
     requirements.txt - requirements file with template text     
     setup.cfg - setup configuration
     setup.py - setup script with template text
     
The texts are created from template, you should rewrite them upon specific needs.     
     
Skeleton command supports several options.
Use option ``--lib-skel-path <path>`` to create skeleton in requested directory.

  .. code-block:: bash
  
     $ htk --lib-skel-path ~/lib create-lib-skel
     
     Completed.
     
Wizard
^^^^^^     
     
Use option ``-i`` or ``--interactive`` to turn on skeleton wizard.
The wizard will guide you through creation process and ask some questions to customize skeleton files.

  .. code-block:: bash
  
     $ htk -i create-lib-skel

     | WhiteForce is shared library developed to use with Hydra Toolkit. 
     | This library provides example functionality, how to develop HydraTK shared libraries
     | It has decent portfolio of features:

     * feature 1
     * feature 2
     * feature 3

     OS and Python versions support
     ==============================

     | Currently the Linux platform with CPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.x is supported, 
     | but the final version is planned to be crossplatform and targeted also to the other popular systems 
     | including Windows and OSX and possibly other Python versions such as Jython and IronPython

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's develop simple library with sorting algorithms.
We will use created source file whiteforce.py and add new methods.  

  .. code-block:: python
  
     def bubble_sort (a):

         cnt = len(a)
         for i in xrange(0, cnt-1):
             for j in xrange(1, cnt-i):
                 if (a[j-1] > a[j]):
                     aux = a[j]
                     a[j] = a[j-1]
                     a[j-1] = aux

         return a    
         
     def selection_sort(a):

        cnt = len(a)
        for i in xrange(0, cnt-2):
            min = a[i]
            idx = i

            for j in xrange(i+1, cnt-1):
                if (a[j] < min):
                    min = a[j]    
                    idx = j

            aux = a[i]
            a[i] = min
            a[idx] = aux

        return a
                  
Install the library as standard Python module.

  .. code-block:: python
  
     $ python setup.py install
     
     Finished processing dependencies for WhiteForce==0.1.0a-dev1
     
     $ pip list | grep WhiteForce
     
     WhiteForce (0.1.0a-dev1)

Now use it from Python console.

  .. code-block:: python
  
     $ python
  
     >>> from hydratk.lib.whiteforce import whiteforce     
     >>> a = [1, 8, 5, 6, 4, 10]
     >>> b = whiteforce.bubble_sort(a)
     >>> print b
     [1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10]
     >>> c = whiteforce.selection_sort(a)
     >>> print c
     [1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10]  
     
  .. note::
  
     If you want to use HydraTK core functionalities (i.e. event, debug messages), HydraTK must be running.
     So you can't use the library just from console. More complex libraries are intended to be used from extensions or core modules.
     
Uninstall library as standard Python module.

  .. code-block:: python
  
     $ pip uninstall WhiteForce
     
     Successfully uninstalled WhiteForce
